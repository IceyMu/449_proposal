\section{Proposed Analysis}
This project uses existing \dmri scans of 10 spinal cords that were donated to the International Spinal Cord Biobank by people who suffered fatal spinal cord injuries that have been analyzed according to the diffusion models DTI, DKI, and SMT, as well as the biophysical models NODDI, ActiveAx, and DBSI. The goal of this project is to investigate the resulting parameters from the previous analyses and finding correlations that are indicators of \sci by comparing areas of healthy tissue to areas of damaged tissue. This will involve first registering the \dmri data to an atlas and generating regions of interest. From these correlations we will evaluate which models are the most effective for a given application.
