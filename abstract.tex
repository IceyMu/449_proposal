Diffusion MRI provides a non-invasive tool for probing the microstructure of spinal cords. Understanding the correlations between spinal cord histology and pathology provides experimental validation of proposed biomarkers as well as a clearer understanding of when they are practical for use in diagnosing and predicting the recovery of spinal cord injuries. %

Image reconstruction of the microstructure from the MRI data requires a prior mathematical model of the structure to fit to. The accuracy and sensitivity of these parameters to the actual histology has yet to be fully explored. %

We propose a study on 10 spinal cords that suffered fatal injuries and were donated to the International Spinal Cord Injury Biobank to map these fit parameters in regions of interest and find correlations in the regions between healthy and damaged spinal cord tissue.
